## FINAL THESIS

# PACKAGING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION
The environmental impact on our planet is a very current, societal problem that motivated the focus of the presented bachelor's thesis. The subject of Packaging in the European Union deals with product packaging and focuses mainly on environmental issues in connection with packaging technologies and materials and their negative effects, caused by insufficient waste recycling and insufficient emphasis on renewable resources. The work brings a proposal to solve this issue and improve the current situation. Instead of packaging design, it focuses on a European Union campaign for grocery chains. In the theoretical part, the classic creation of packaging and its procedures are mentioned. It also mentions the sustainability of packaging and its issues. It characterizes the campaign and describes its integral parts. Last but not least, it deals with the European Union and its actions in favor of the environment and points to the unity of the member states' market.

In the practical part, the thesis deals with the proposal of a solution to the problem of packaging. It shows the visual solution of the campaign. It discusses essential parts of the campaign such as the effect of the logo. It illuminates the functionality of websites, social networks and media. It presents practical products under the auspices of the EU.

## Logo
THE LOGO IS BASED ON THE LETTER O, WHICH IS NARROW AND SYMBOLIZES ZERO. AN ARROW POINTING DOWN COMES FROM THE END OF THE LETTER. THAT MEANS ZERO WASTE. WHICH IS EXACTLY THE MESSAGE THE EUROPEAN UNION WANTS TO SEND

For easier dissemination of the 
campaign to all member states of the European Union, the English language is used. Both for logos and slogans. The campaign‘s target audience is mainly young to middle-aged, between 18 and 45 years old, and due to the addition of English to the EU school curriculum, it is not difficult for many people to translate simple slogans into their native language. Another reason for using mainly the English language is the fact that it is a world language.

Another important aspect is color. It is a priority that both entrepreneurs and potential consumers remember certain concepts under the color scale. For an environmental campaign that aims to reduce the consumption of materials, it is of course the color green. 
It is closely connected with nature in people‘s consciousness. For better manipulation with black or white backgrounds, I chose two shades of green. One dark green that evokes natural wooded vegetation and forests, reminiscent of pine green. The second shade is light green, which symbolizes a light grass meadow. These are the two primary colors that the campaign uses the most. Other secondary colors for the campaign are bright orange yellow and white ivory. Orange-yellow serves to connect with the European Union and its orange-yellow stars on the EU flag.

## Media and web
For comprehensive communication, it is necessary to have a well-functioning website that will help potential 
customers and entrepreneurs to find 
information about the campaign. 
The website would serve to communicate the objectives of the European Union and reduce environmental waste to a minimum. On the website of the campaign, it would be possible to switch the text to the individual languages of the member states, as is already the case on the official website of the European Union. As already indicated, with the creation of the campaign, websites would also be created under the auspices of the EU. These would contain all sorts of information. From various articles to information about added store chains where such a purchase method can be made.

Websites would be simpler in nature. The navigation system would be simple. A potential customer would easily find their way around using the menu icon, where they would find a detailed division of the website into given segments. For example, this would be information about the campaign, articles, improving the prosperity of nature, shops that have been involved. The website would provide instructional videos to operate the machines upon agreement with the company.
