## Work Experience

### RUGBY
Czech women‘s rugby team was a teamwork. 
We focused on popularizing women‘s rugby. 
Audience was young woman (18 - 24 age). 
Our strategy was sharper than other teams. 
The visual style was in a black and red variant 
to make it look more aggressive and be better remembered.

### BEER VATICAN
As part of the project, 
we worked on the idea of combining two distinctive 
things in the Czech Republic. 
That‘s beer and atheism and  put them together to make beer faith. 
This is the visual identity of the city of Volhynia, 
which is known for strong relationship with beer. 
We treated it like any other identity of the city and a whole communication was created.
