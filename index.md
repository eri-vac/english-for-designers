# About me
## My story 
 Hello. I´m Erika and I come from Prague. 
 I´m studying graphic design. 
 I love music, books, art and illustration. 
 I often go to art exhibitions for inspiration. 
 I like clean and simple work. 
 I´m focusing on illustration.
 
## Voice and ton
1. I show myself as I am, which means quiet and nervous. 
2. I think it's obvious at first glance that I'm an introvert 
and struggle with communication both spoken and written. 
3. But I can act professionally

# Case study
Logo manual: 
 I worked on a school project whose assignment was a logo manual. I chose Jihlava zoo because their communication elements were as outdated as their logo. The advantage was that I had recently been to the zoo in question.
The first what I do was research and evaluate the competition. after that I started making designs for the logo. I drew  meny designs on paper and choise good one. 
Whan I created logo I started with logo manual. I folowed logo manual for Prague zoo, becauce I didn´t know how it looks like. 
I created more material: posters, brochures, maps and billboards. Brochures folowed bacis informations from the webside.  
I created pictograms to create communication. Also I opened the zoo map and redesigned it in a new style with easy navigation. With color of the logo and all communication. Logo manual has almost 30 pages contained color, backgrounds, minimal largest
