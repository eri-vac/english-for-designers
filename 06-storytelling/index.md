# Storytelling
The feeling of holding a record cover in your hand is incomparable to looking at a photo of the album on your phone. My father brought me to this idea when one day he moved all his plates from the cottage of the house and I looked again after a long time.
so I was full of inspiration and got to work. 

I didn't just want to design some covers on the computer, but I wanted to go further. I decided to adapt my cartoon designs for linocut. In linocut printing, I tried many colored and monochrome variants, but for the selected band I liked the classic combination of red and black colors with complementary white color the most. In my eyes, linocut's greatest strength lies in its inaccuracy and failed pieces, because this way very interesting things are created, even if only unintentionally.

When I had selected a specific print, it was time to sit down at the computer and continue working. I used photoshop exclusively for editing the print, where the work was very fast. it was just editing and adding text. So the cover was born.
